# NeurophSamples
  
  This project contains a few samples of use MultiLayerPerceptron network to solve classification problem. 

## Samples

  This project contains: 
  
  1) AdalineDigitsSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for pattern recognition. Example teaches the adaline to recognize the 10 digits. It's based on a an example from Encog (Encog Examples/org.encog.examples.neural.adaline).
  
  2) ForestCoverType - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Encog (Encog Examples/org.encog.examples.neural.forest).
