# NeurophSamples
  
  This project contains a few sample of using MultiLayerPerceptron network to solve classification problem. 

## Samples

  This project contains: 
  
  1) AdalineDigitsSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for pattern recognition. Example teaches the adaline to recognize the 10 digits. It's based on a an example from Encog (Encog Examples/org.encog.examples.neural.adaline).
  
  2) ForestCoverType - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Encog (Encog Examples/org.encog.examples.neural.forest). The original data set and description can be found at link:  http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/covtype.data.gz
  
  3) BrestCancerSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Weka. The original data set and description can be found at link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/wdbc.data
  
  4) DiabetesSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Weka. The original data set and description can be found at link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/pima-indians-diabetes/pima-indians-diabetes.data
  
  5) GermanCreditDataSample - DiabetesSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Weka. The original data set and description can be found at link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/statlog/german/german.data-numeric
  
  6) IonosphereSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Weka. The original data set and description can be found at link: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/ionosphere/ionosphere.data
  
  7) SegmentChallengeSample - In this sample MultiLayerPerceptron network is used for classification problem. It's based on a example from Weka. The original data set and description can be found at link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/image/segmentation.data
  
  **All data sets are corrected to contains only numeric value. 
  
  **Description of all samples can be also found in the project.
